# Heat-Map-Generator - intended to visualize global sales data distribution. Creates nodes for each location that shows the amount, location details, and period

#Requires user to import an Excel file with data sorted in MONTH, CITY STATE, and AMOUNT columns.

#It may take a bit to generate the heat map for larger data sets. The heat map is saved as an html file, usually in the /user/ folder.
