# Heat-Map-Generator

Intended to visualize global sales data distribution. Creates nodes for each location that shows the amount, location details, and period

Requires user to import an Excel file with data sorted in MONTH, CITY STATE, and AMOUNT columns.

It may take a bit to generate the heat map for larger data sets. The heat map is saved as an html file, usually in the /user/ folder. 

This repository includes an example heatmap dataset - Example Sales Data.xls - that is sorted in the way that would be suitable for the program.
The consequent heatmap.html can be downloaded or viewed at matthewmueller.me/heatmap.html
